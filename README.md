OYO Rooms Revenue Insights    Oct2024

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, I focused on understanding the client’s specific needs rather than vague recommendations. Key metrics were identified to guide the analysis, including:

•	RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
•	DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
•	ADR (Average Daily Rate)
•	DURN (Daily Utilized Room)

These metrics, along with overall revenue and occupancy percentage, would be crucial for the analysis.


2. Dashboard Development

I developed measures and columns to enhance the dashboard, incorporating the key metrics discussed earlier, as well as specific metrics for weekdays with higher customer expectations. 

I created a chart to visualize the sources of customer acquisition through different booking channels. Additionally, a donut chart illustrated the proportion of business clientele.

To capture trends, I included metrics comparing RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy percentage. After adding filters for cities and slicers,
 I implemented a matrix displaying performance across various branches and locations, highlighting key metrics. Data bars were used where applicable, along with conditional formatting to indicate increases or decreases in key metrics on a week-over-week basis.


3. Insights and Recommendations
The primary goal of this analysis is to maximize profit. Based on the dashboard insights, I recommend increasing room prices on peak days when demand exceeds that of weekdays.

 This can be evaluated using the RevPAR trendline. Implementing a flexible pricing strategy, as seen in other hospitality businesses during vacation seasons, can help capture additional profits rather than relying on fixed pricing.

Moreover, I suggest adjusting pricing strategies for weekdays and weekends, establishing different ADRs for each. 
Notably, hotels with the lowest occupancy rates also tend to have the lowest ratings and high cancellation rates. 
Offering promotional deals for these rooms, such as complimentary night stays or enhanced customer service, could significantly improve occupancy rates.
